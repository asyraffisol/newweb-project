    <h2>Internship Experience 🏢</h2>

    <p>
        I completed an <strong>8-week industrial training</strong> at 
        <strong>Pejabat Daerah Kota Setar (PDKS)</strong>. During this internship,
        I was assigned to both the <strong>Administrative Division</strong> and the
        <strong>Development Division</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Throughout the training period, I was involved in handling documentation,
        managing records, preparing reports, and assisting officers with daily
        office operations. This experience allowed me to apply theoretical
        knowledge from the <strong>Information Management program</strong> into a
        real working environment.
    </p>

    <p>
        The internship also enhanced my understanding of how district government
        agencies function, particularly in managing public administration and
        supporting community development initiatives.

    <h2>Part-Time Job Experience 🛠️</h2>

    <p>
        In addition to my internship experience, I was also involved in
        <strong>part-time work related to machinery servicing and repair</strong>.
        I assisted my father and brother in maintaining, servicing, and repairing
        heavy machinery and agricultural tractors.
    </p>

    <p>
        This experience helped me develop practical skills such as teamwork,
        problem-solving, and basic mechanical knowledge. It also trained me to be
        more responsible, disciplined, and confident when handling technical
        tasks in a real working environment.
